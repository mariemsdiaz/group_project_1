# *Tax Incentives and Diversity of Supply*

Starting this analysis, we wanted to get an overview of the data we had available to get a big picture of our story and find interesting aspects to further explore. We looked up total cars, unique cars, amount of cars per city, and what year had the largest amount of registrations. We didn't have the year the car was registered, bu we had the year of the car make so we were able to find a summary of the last ten years to visualize any trends.

[top_4_models.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16242925/top_4_models.pdf)

*Statistical Interpretation:*
Slope: The slope of 457.10 indicates that for each additional car model introduced, there are on average 457.10 more registered vehicles.
Intercept: The intercept of -1714.18 is part of the regression equation.
R-squared: The R-squared value of 0.71 suggests that approximately 71% of the variability in the total number of vehicles can be explained by the number of car models available.
P-value: The p-value of 0.00 confirms that the regression model is statistically significant.

![Fig5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e61745cc-8640-4006-9042-65b1e725ec33)

*Conclusion:*
This analysis reveals a strong positive relationship between the availability of car models and the total number of registered electric vehicles per year. Based on this we  can infer that the number of car models available could potentially drive higher vehicle registrations, highlighting the importance of diversity in model offerings to boost electric vehicle adoption. Our hypothesis was proven, as we believed that as demand for EV's increases, supply increases in variability giving the consumer more options. The statistical significance of these findings further further supports the strengtht of this relationship.

*Relationship between Eligibility that Meet Government’s Standards for Tax Credits and Registered Cars*

*Overview:*
The second relationship we wanted to explore, seems ovious and interesting at first. We wanted to see if Goverment programs created a strong enough incentive to increase demand in Electric Vehicles. We filtered the electric vehicle data to determine vehicles eligible for a potential tax credit under the "Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility" criterion. This analysis would help us understand the relationship between eligibility for tax credits and the total number of registered electric vehicles.
We wanted to start narrowing down our analysis by grouping my car data by eligible, and seeing if there is a correlation between this potential tax credit and purchase trends.

![Fig1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd7ca6fa-e9b8-4b8c-9bd3-5df38e4f7e40)

*Statistical Interpretation:*
We ran a linear regression analysis including Pearson's R, to find the strenght of this relationship, and then we ploted my graph accodingly. 
The R-squared value of 0.17 indicates that approximately 17% of the variability in the total number of vehicles can be explained by the number of eligible vehicles. This suggests a weak but positive relationship. There might be other significant factors influencing the total number of vehicles that are not captured by this model.

<img width="997" alt="Screenshot 2024-07-16 at 11 24 52 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3a74e95-b820-4bf5-80f6-c48427d12e4e">

![Fig4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/738ccad1-b62c-4aa9-a215-bd949d7949c9)

This indicates that for each additional eligible vehicle, there is an estimated average increase of approximately 1.56 in the total number of vehicles. This suggests that vehicles eligible for government incentives or benefits are positively contributing to the total number of registered vehicles

*Conclusion:*
The analysis proves that their a weak positive relationship between the availability of government tax credits for clean alternative fuel vehicles and the total number of registered electric vehicles. Even thought there is an increase in eligible vehicles as the total number of registered vehicles grows, the effect is not very strong. This finding was surpising, as we expected that a potential tax incentive would intice a higher response in demand. This suggests that other factors, for example infrastructure, consumer education or gas price, could be playing a bigger role when it comes to determining electric vehicle growth in the State of Washington. 

 
# **Conclusion:** 
As we embark on this journey of exploration, it is clear that electric vehicles represent not just a mode of transport, but a paradigm shift towards a cleaner, more sustainable future. Through this research project, we succeded in illuminating the factors responsible for contributing to the growth of EVs in Washington State, paving the way for informed decisions and transformative policies and consumer decesions in the years to come.

# Summary of Regression Analysis on EV Data
In our analysis, we performed regression analysis to explore the relationship between various factors in the electric vehicle (EV) dataset. Specifically, we examined the following correlations:

**Household Median Income vs. Number of EVs:**

Objective: To determine if there's a correlation between household median income and the number of EVs in different counties.
Method: We merged the EV data with county household median income data and performed a simple linear regression analysis.

Results:
R-squared: 0.55, indicating a moderate positive correlation.
Interpretation: This suggests that higher-income households are more likely to purchase EVs, showing that income is a significant factor in EV adoption.
Graph: The scatter plot with a regression line and the equation was presented, showing the positive trend between income and EV numbers.

**Gasoline Prices vs. Number of EVs:**

Objective: To investigate if rising gasoline prices contribute to an increase in EV sales.
Method: We used historical gasoline price data and matched it with EV sales data by model year to perform a regression analysis.

Results:
R-squared: 0.25, indicating a weak positive correlation.
Interpretation: This weak correlation suggests that while high gasoline prices might influence some consumers to switch to EVs, it's not the primary driver of EV sales. Other factors likely play more significant roles.

Graph: The scatter plot with a regression line showed that the relationship between gasoline prices and EV sales is not strong.

**Detailed Findings:**
**Household Median Income vs. Number of EVs:**
Data Preparation: We merged county data on household median income with the EV data, ensuring any missing income data was handled appropriately. Regression Results: Graphical Representation: The regression line on the scatter plot provided a visual affirmation of the positive correlation.

**Gasoline Prices vs. Number of EVs:**
Data Preparation: Gasoline prices were averaged by year and merged with EV sales data by model year.
Regression Results:
Graphical Representation: The scatter plot with the regression line demonstrated the weak positive trend.
Conclusion:
The regression analyses provided insights into the factors influencing EV adoption. Higher household median incomes were moderately correlated with increased EV numbers, suggesting economic capability is a crucial factor. Conversely, gasoline prices showed only a weak correlation with EV sales, indicating that while fuel costs might impact consumer decisions, they are not the predominant factor driving the adoption of electric vehicles. These findings help understand the market dynamics and the influences on EV adoption.
